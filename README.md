Hi there!

This is a really simple Personal Portfolio Website.
Built using pure HTML and CSS!

This project is part of Free Code Camp's "Responsive Web Design Certification" course.
I'm really excited to share this with you!

I also followed strict user stories (which I would list below) in order to pass the code testing while designing this.

Here are the user stories: 

User Story #1: My portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.

User Story #2: The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text.

User Story #3: My portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects.

User Story #4: The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.

User Story #5: The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.

User Story #6: My portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar.

User Story #7: The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.

User Story #8: My portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.

User Story #9: My portfolio should have at least one media query.

User Story #10: The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.

User Story #11: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

This was a really short and fun project.
Let me know what you think!
